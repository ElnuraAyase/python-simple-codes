# The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")

# The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement. 

  for x in range(6):
      if x == 3: break
      print(x)
  else:
  print("Finally finished!")
